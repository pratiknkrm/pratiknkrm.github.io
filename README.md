## 🚀 Featured Project: Enterprise Hybrid Lab Environment

To continuously sharpen my skills, I designed, built, and currently maintain a secure, segmented enterprise lab environment. 

### 1. Network Architecture & Security
* Deployed **OPNsense** as a virtualized enterprise firewall to manage traffic between untrusted physical networks and secure virtual environments.
* Engineered secure **VLANs** (e.g., VLAN 99) to isolate critical infrastructure from standard user traffic, simulating a Zero-Trust network approach.

### 2. Identity & Access Management (Active Directory)
* Provisioned a **Windows Server Domain Controller** (`corp.local`) with static IP addressing and internal DNS routing.
* Designed an Organizational Unit (OU) hierarchy separating standard users from privileged admin accounts.
* Implemented **Group Policy (GPO)** to enforce security baselines, including mandatory legal login banners across the domain.

### 3. Linux Web Services
* Deployed lightweight **Ubuntu LXC containers** to host internal services with minimal resource overhead.
* Configured an **Nginx** web server, successfully troubleshooting DNS resolution and package daemon failures during deployment.
